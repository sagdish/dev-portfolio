## My personal website updated for 2020 and some years after (hopefully), loved and hated sometimes.

Main focus was to get away from convensional approach for portfolio websites. Then It kinda grew on me and I desided to add blog option, playground for random and interesting small projects.<br/> Goal was againts using UI frameworks that control screen sizes; only pure and raw CSS rules to control view from mobile to desktop. Some hickups here and there, but overal I think it nicely suits all devices.

### Some Hightlights

- Carousel(pure-react-carousel) in the main page and animation.
- Stoic quote generator (seen in carousel slide or in Playground page) - built with React spring module.
- Multi function, single navigation button. Also with the help of React spring.
- Analogue clock - pure JS date object, inside useEffect hook and some confusing CSS.
- And some other hiche details I don't remember.
